# Quasar UI

This is my personal try to port the original Gekko UI to the Quasar Framework for practice.

## Usage

Since this is still a **WIP** currently (meaning not all pages and components are fully ported), this repo only runs in DEV-Mode.

To install, follow these steps:

1. Install Quasar-CLI via npm `npm install -g quasar-cli`
2. Clone this repo to some location on your harddrive (should work from any directory in DEV-Mode).
3. Fire up your gekko in UI-Mode.
4. CD into cloned repository and start the UI with `quasar dev`

***If you changed your default connection or database-settings, please edit the file ***`<gekko-quasar-ui-folder>/src/statics/UIConfig.js`*** accordingly.***





If you like the ported UI, drop me some coins for coffee ;)
